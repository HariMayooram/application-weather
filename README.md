# application-weather

In this project, an application was created which was asynchronous in nature with the help of different web API such that the data of the user was gathered to dynamically update the UI in an application which would be used for weather journal application.

This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.
